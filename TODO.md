## Project To Do List
- [x] Upgrade `README.md`
    - improve documentation and explain project goals, setup, and usage clearly.

- [] Refactor All Scripts
    - Make the code more readable, modular, and efficient.

- [] Make All Scripts Functional
    - Ensure all scripts use functional design for pipeline compatibility.

- []Upgrade `data_harvester.py`
    - Refactor logic, ensure correct file handling, logging, and fault-tolerance.

- [] Refactor `train_ann.py`
    - Improve training logic, modularity, and model saving/loading.

- [] Improve Remaining Scripts
    - Apply same standards to other scripts (`predictor.py`, `simulate_data.py`, etc.).

- [] Write `mkdir.py` for Documentation Structure
    - Automatically create standard folders for organizing documentation and outputs.

- [] Create `main.py` as Central Pipeline
    - Use this to orchestrate harvesting → training → testing.

- [] Simplify Complex Scripts
    - Split large scripts into small, reusable modules or helper functions.

- [] Improve Logging System
    - Create `comment.py` or similar for enriched, standardized log entries.

- [] Combine *ANN* and *CNN* Models
    - Build a multi-model system and extend pipeline accordingly.
