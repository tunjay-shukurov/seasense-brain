## üß† Key Features

- Automated SAC file labeling based on event magnitude (threshold: M ‚â• 4.5 = earthquake)
- Extraction of features from both real and synthetic data
- Training of feedforward artificial neural networks (ANN)
- Future extension: integration with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Switch from TensorFlow (.h5) to PyTorch (.pt) model format
- Modular code with clear structure and separation of logic

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tunjay-shukurov/seasense-brain.git
cd seasense-brain
```
### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional):
```bash
python -m venv env_pt
source env_pt/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
env_pt\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```
### 3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Run data processing:
```bash
python scripts/data_harvester.py
```
### 5. Create synthetic data:
```bash
python scripts/simulate_data.py
```

### 6. Train the model:
```bash
python scripts/train_ann.py
```
### 7. Predict using a trained model:
```bash
python scripts/predictor.py
```

## Notes

    Log files are saved under logs/ and follow a timestamped structure

    Feature extraction is modularized in feature_extractor.py   

    Synthetic data can be generated with simulate_data.py

## üîÆ Future Plans

    Transition to fully convolutional CNN model

    Real-time prediction support

    Model performance dashboard (TensorBoard or matplotlib)

    Better error handling and progress tracking
